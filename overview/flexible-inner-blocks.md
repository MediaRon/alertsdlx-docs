# Flexible Inner Blocks

By default, AlertsDLX alert blocks contain a single paragraph block for the alert description. **Flexible InnerBlocks (Advanced)** lets you insert any block type inside the alert shell.

## Default Behavior

Without the advanced option enabled, the alert description area accepts `core/paragraph` blocks only. This keeps alert content simple and predictable.

## Enabling Flexible InnerBlocks

1. Select an alert block.
2. Open the block **Settings** sidebar panel.
3. Enable **Flexible InnerBlocks (Advanced)**.

You can now add lists, images, columns, buttons, and other blocks inside the styled alert container.

## Styling Expectations

The alert shell (background, border, icon, title, close button) is styled by AlertsDLX. **Inner block styling beyond basic paragraph text may depend on your theme.**

For example:

* A list inside an alert inherits your theme's list styles.
* Images may need alignment or spacing adjustments from your theme or custom CSS.
* Complex layouts (columns, groups) work but may not match the alert's built-in typography.

Test on the frontend after adding non-paragraph blocks.

## When to Use Advanced InnerBlocks

* Multi-step instructions with ordered lists inside a warning callout.
* An info alert with an inline image and caption.
* A promo alert with a button block plus supporting paragraph text.

For simple tips and notes, the default paragraph-only mode is usually sufficient.
